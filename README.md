# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal is to analyze and make connections between housing prices and the ways people spend their money.

## Process
### Step 1: Connecting Data Sources to Tableau
For all files except one this process was a simple drag and drop.
weekly_earnings.json however was a mess that needed cleaning. I removed all the unrelated information from the json file and was left with just the information I needed to analyze the weekly_earnings of canadians over the years.

### (your step 2)

## Results
I chose option 1: Standard Final Project.
(discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
Trying to import the json file into tableau was tricky, however I was able to use Python and the json library to clean the data and get it ready for analysis.

## Future Goals
If I had more time I would try and do one of the other non standard final projects, some of those topics interest me and I believe that curiosty would help me take my analysis skills to a new level.
